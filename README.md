# TypeScript Type Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error involving type mismatches in function arguments. The `bug.ts` file contains a function that expects two numbers but receives a string as the second argument, resulting in a type error.

The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix the issue by ensuring all arguments passed to the function are of the correct type.
